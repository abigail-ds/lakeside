Lakeside Driving School was started in 2021 in an effort to deliver the highest quality of driver education using tailored learning. Our instructors use new learnerâ€™s interest, strengths and needs as a guide so they are able to engage students in a collaborative cycle of learning. We adjust personalized goals and learning experience to ensure students become confident drivers.


Our instructors have successfully passed an in-depth driving/criminal history check and are certified and licensed to teach by the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles. Lakeside Driving School is authorized, bonded, insured and certified by the Department of Motor Vehicles of Virginia.
