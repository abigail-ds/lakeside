title: Learner's Permit Study Session
---
There is a two-part knowledge exam that is taken on a computer at the DMV. The exam tests your knowledge of traffic signs, motor vehicle laws and safe driving techniques.

Exam questions are taken from information in the Virginia Driver's Manual. All ten traffic sign questions in Part One must be answered correctly before you can take the general knowledge exam in Part Two. You must score at least 80% on these questions to pass Part Two.

**Class** - we offer three hours of study session private/or with a group (no more than 5 students). To prepare for the knowledge exam, we help students familiarize all necessary information in the Virginia Driver's Manual and give you opportunity to take several sample tests.

**Pre-requisite**: This class is intended for individuals that are 15 years & 6 months. You must NOT have taken the learner's permit test a third time. If you took the test a third time, you need to take the "Driver's Manual - Re-Examination Class."

**Fee:** $100
