Lakeside Driving School provides driver improvement course for those in Richmond, Virginia. Our scheduling is very flexible to ensure that all our students can attend and learn proper defensive driving techniques. We use the [Virginia Focused Driver Improvement Program](https://drivertraining4virginia.com/) curriculum by [MGA Consulting LLC](https://www.mgaconsulting.co/). The certificates we issue is acknowledged by Virginia’s DMV and Court System. Upon completion of the course, we will report your completion records to the DMV within 24 hours.

**Reasons for why you would take this class:**

**Voluntarily:**  Drivers completing clinic voluntarily. Safe driving points are awarded

**Court Required:** Drivers required by the court to complete clinic. If you have not been to court, you are not court directed. A court document stating that the driver is to be awarded safe driving points must be presented to the clinic. Safe driving points will not be awarded if this documentation is not received by the clinic.

**DMV Required:** If you have been instructed by [DMV](https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/drivers/#points.asp) to take a driver improvement clinic, you will have 90 days to complete this course. If you fail to satisfactorily complete the clinic within 90 days, your driving privileges will be suspended until you meet this requirement. Safe driving points are awarded for drivers 18 and over. Drivers under age 18 will not be awarded safe driving points if the clinic attendance was required by DMV.

**Cost:** The class is $100. Classes are held on Saturday mornings and upon request on weekdays and Sundays, same price call or text 804-823-7730.

**Length of class for drivers aged 55 years and older:** Per [Virginia Administrative Code 24VAC20-40-30 (B)](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincode/title24/agency20/chapter40/section30/) the eight hours of class time can be divided over at least a two-day period for individuals 55 years and older. This will guarantee flexibility for your schedule and allow you to get time to digest and understand all the safety information learned.
