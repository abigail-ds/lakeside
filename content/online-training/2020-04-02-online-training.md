#### How It Works

* The program consists of at least 30 hours of instructions and includes components about alcohol safety, drug abuse awareness, aggressive driving, distracted driving, pedestrian and bicycle safety, handicapped parking, fuel efficient driving practices, motorcycle awareness and organ and tissue donation awareness as required by law.
* You must be at least 15 years and 6 months old to take the online driver education course. All individuals who elect to take the classroom component of the driver education course online must take the online course through a DMV licensed driver training school. Home schooled students are exempt from this requirement.
* In order to benefit from the course, you must be able to work independently and be comfortable with using a computer.

#### Testing procedures:

Contact the school via email - [abigailsinstructor@gmail.com ](https://abigailsdrivingschool.com/en/abigailsinstructor@gmail.com)to schedule the test.

On the day of testing, you must bring the following to the test site:

* Photo identification (DMV issued identification card, school issued identification card, valid passport or military identification)
* Proof of completion of the on-line driver education course
* A completed “Parental Consent for Online Driver Education Examination” ([dts62](http://www.safedrivingacademy.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dts62.pdf)), if you are under age 18. You can download it from here.

The online driver training school – Lakeside Driving School - will provide a computer for testing.

#### Steps to Student Completion for the Virginia driver education course

1. You can register yourself directly at [Virginia Online Driver Education](https://dev.nationaldrivertraining.com/aff-landing.php?age=Teen&state=VA&affid=1081&pid=23).
2. The student immediately receives a user name, password, and link to enter the course: <https://dev.nationaldrivertraining.com/login.php>

Virginia Driver Education Approved by the Department of Education. State Approved – Virginia Department of Motor Vehicle Approved Online Driver Education Course.

1. The student logs in and begins the approved online course as instructed.
2. The student receives a directive to return to Lakeside Driving School to take the final exam. The student is given written verification of completion of the theory portion of driver education. This document verifies to the school that the student has completed this portion of the course and is ready to take the final exam.
3. Lakeside Driving School´s licensed instructor logs into the course and opens the testing site for each student who presents the written verification of completion document entering their seven digit student authorization code.
4. The student takes the final examination online in the presence of the licensed instructor.
5. The course grades the test and reveals the results. If the student passes the course, the instructor will receive the certificate of completion for that student and can continue with the behind-the-wheel portion of the course or issue the certificate to the student when there is a request to transfer. If the student fails the examination, the student will be allowed to review any section of the completed course to prepare to take the examination again.

(if you cancel an online course after your login access to the course has been created a $42.00 processing fee will be charged from your refund request)
